# WriteLine
## Functionality
This C++ program allows the user to **write a single line of text to a text file** from the command line. 

It takes two arguments from the user: the name of **the file to write** to, and the **text to write**.
## How to compile and run
```
make clean
make build
./build/bin/WriteLine.exe <file> <line>
```
